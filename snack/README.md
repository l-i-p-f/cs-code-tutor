My proposal for the final project is to design a game like Gluttonous Snake by using C++
.

I may first download SFML and link it to the Vscode.

How is it special?

I can use pointers to manage dynamic objects (e.g., snake segments, food, power-ups).

I can add smooth animations, sound effects, and background music to improve the user
experience.

And I can have two players in one game

## Game Structure Overview
● Game Loop

● Snake Object: The snake is represented as a series of blocks. Each block is a
segment of the snake, and the snake's length increases when it eats food.

● Food Object: Food is placed randomly on the screen. When the snake collides with
it, the snake grows, and the score increases.

● Collision Detection: If the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game ends.

● Score System: Track and display the score.

## Enhancements
● Add a game over screen when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

● Introduce a speed increase over time to make the game more challenging.

● Add sound effects for eating food and colliding with objects.

## What can I use in my code?
### Using Pointers for Dynamic Object Management
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Use pointers to dynamically allocate objects (e.g., snake
segments, food, obstacles), which helps manage memory more efficiently.
### Object-Oriented Design (OOP) for Flexibility
I can make my game more special by introducing inheritance and polymorphism. For instance, I
can have different types of game objects, like Snake, Food, and Obstacle, each derived from a
common GameObject base class. This allows for more flexibility in managing objects. Eg.using
Inheritance for Game Objects.
### Sound and Music
I can add sound effects and background music to make the game more engaging. SFML has a
built-in Audio module that allows me to load and play sound files.
### Animations and Transitions
I can add special animations to make my game more visually appealing. For instance, when the
snake eats food or grows, I can animate the process using timers or animation states.
### High Scores and Persistence
I can also add a high score system where the player’s highest score is saved to a file (e.g., text
file) so it can persist between sessions.
